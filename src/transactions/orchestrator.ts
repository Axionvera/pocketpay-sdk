/**
 * Stellar PocketPay SDK — Transaction lifecycle orchestrator.
 *
 * Implements the five stage boundaries of
 * [ADR 0005](../../docs/adr/0005-transaction-lifecycle.md) over the modules that
 * already exist: preparation in `transactions/offline-preparation.ts`, sequence
 * in `account/sequence.ts`, guarded submission and polling in
 * `network/idempotency.ts`, outcome classification in `errors/index.ts`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The piece this module exists for is {@link submitGuarded}. The SDK shipped
 * `submitTransactionIdempotently` with a single call site — `retry-policy.ts` —
 * while three paths submitted straight to Horizon with no duplicate protection
 * at all. Routing every write through one guarded entry point is the point of
 * the orchestrator, not an incidental benefit of it.
 *
 * @security A submission timeout does not prove failure. Per ADR 0005,
 * "unresolved is not failure": the envelope may already be on-chain, so the
 * only safe recovery is to poll, never to resubmit or rebuild blindly.

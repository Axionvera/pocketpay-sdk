/**
 * Stellar PocketPay SDK — Vault action intents and capability gating.
 *
 * The vault module was a barrel: 31 lines of re-exports from `../soroban`, with
 * no logic of its own. Its real surface is `depositToVault`,
 * `withdrawFromVault` and `getVaultBalance`; lock creation, lock listing and
 * matured-lock withdrawal had no representation anywhere in the SDK, so a
 * consumer had no way to ask whether they existed short of reading the source.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The gating this module needs was already published and simply never called
 * from here. `SDK_CAPABILITIES['vault.contract']` (`src/errors/capabilities.ts`)
 * declares the contract requirement with its `requires` string, and
 * `assertCapability` already routes a `planned` or `unsupported` capability to
 * `UnsupportedFeatureError` and everything else to `CapabilityMismatchError`.
 * Grepping `src/vault/` for `capabilit` or `unsupported` used to return nothing.
 *
 * @security Intents carry `sourceSecret`. Nothing in this module echoes an
 * intent into an error message or a result — `DIAGNOSTICS_SENSITIVE_KEYS`
 * lists `sourceSecret` among the keys that must never surface.

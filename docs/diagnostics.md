# SDK Diagnostics and Safe Support Workflows

Opt-in diagnostics help apps and support engineers debug configuration, network
state, transaction lifecycle, wallet capability, and vault readiness **without**
leaking secret keys, seed phrases, signed XDR, or other sensitive material.

> [!CAUTION]
> Diagnostics are **off by default**. Never enable event hooks in production
> log pipelines that are not already scrubbed. Even with redaction, prefer the
> structured `buildDiagnosticsReport()` snapshot for support tickets over
> dumping raw console output.

## Quick start

```ts
import {
  enableDiagnostics,
  disableDiagnostics,
  buildDiagnosticsReport,
  createWallet,
  type DiagnosticsEvent,
} from 'stellar-pocketpay-sdk';

const events: DiagnosticsEvent[] = [];

enableDiagnostics({
  hooks: {
    onEvent: (event) => {
      // Already redacted — safe to forward to your logger
      console.debug('[pocketpay]', event.domain, event.type, event.data);
      events.push(event);
    },
  },
});

createWallet(); // emits wallet.created with publicKey only (no secretKey value)

const report = buildDiagnosticsReport({ network: 'testnet' });
// Attach `report` to a support ticket — it contains URLs, capability status,
// and vault readiness flags, never signing material.

disableDiagnostics(); // clear hooks when done
```

Environment note: `POCKETPAY_DEBUG=true` alone does **not** start emitting
events. You must still call `enableDiagnostics` / `setDiagnosticsHooks`. Debug
mode expectations for application loggers remain documented in
[logging-payloads-and-debug.md](./logging-payloads-and-debug.md).

## What is safe vs never shared

| Value | In events / report? |
| --- | --- |
| Public key (`G…`), tx hash, ledger, network name, Horizon/Soroban URLs | Yes |
| Capability status, vault readiness, timeout | Yes |
| Contract id (`C…`) when configured | Yes (on-chain public) |
| Secret key, mnemonic, seed, signed XDR, signatures, `sourceSecret` | **Never** — replaced with `[REDACTED]` |
| Memo text | Not included in diagnostics events by default |

Redaction is implemented by `redactDiagnosticsValue` using the deny-list in
`DIAGNOSTICS_SENSITIVE_KEYS`, plus string scrubbing for embedded `S…` keys.

## Lifecycle events (when enabled)

| Domain | Example `type` | Typical `data` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config` | `config.resolved` | network, URLs, timeout, `contractIdConfigured` |
| `wallet` | `wallet.created` / `wallet.imported` | `publicKey`, `hasSecretKey: true` |
| `transaction` | `transaction.submit.*` / `transaction.history.fetched` | txHash, counts — not envelopes |
| `network` | `network.retry.attempt` | attempt, outcome kind, delayMs, txHash |
| `vault` | `vault.readiness` | `ready`, operation, configuration flags |

## Support workflow

1. Reproduce with diagnostics enabled in a **non-production** environment.
2. Call `buildDiagnosticsReport()` and save the JSON (no secrets).
3. Collect redacted event traces for the failing operation (`type` + `data`).
4. Share the report + event types with support — **never** paste wallet backups,
   seed phrases, or signed XDR.
5. Call `disableDiagnostics()` when finished.

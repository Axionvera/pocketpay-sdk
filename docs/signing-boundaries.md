# Signing Boundaries

This document explains where secret material lives, what can sign, how the
SDK checks signing capability before it ever calls a signer, and how future
external signers (mobile, browser, hardware) plug in. It is the security
reference for the signer capability architecture built on top of the
[account abstraction layer](./account-abstraction.md) (see also
[ADR-0002](./adr/0002-account-abstraction.md) and
[ADR-0004](./adr/0004-signer-capability-architecture.md)).

## The four boundaries

| Concept | Type | Carries a secret? | Can sign? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity | `AccountIdentity` | Never | No — it's just a public key |
| Local secret-bearing state | `LocalSignerConfig` (input) / `LocalSigner` (instance) | Yes, encapsulated | Yes |
| Signing capability | `Signer` / `ExternalSignerAdapter` | Depends on implementation | Yes, by contract |
| Account handle | `ReadOnlyAccount` \| `SigningAccount` (the `AccountAbstraction` union) | Never directly — delegates to `Signer` | Only `SigningAccount` |

Submission (`submitSignedTransaction`, `server.submitTransaction`) is
agnostic to how a transaction was signed — it only requires a signed
envelope, never a secret.

## Which type carries secrets

Exactly one type accepts secret material as input: `LocalSignerConfig`
(`{ secretKey: string }`), consumed by `LocalSigner`'s constructor and by the
`createLocalAccount(secretKey)` / `createLocalSigner(secretKey)` factories.

Once constructed, `LocalSigner` holds the derived `@stellar/stellar-sdk`
`Keypair` in a private field. No public type in the account abstraction layer
declares a `secretKey` or `secret` field:

- `AccountIdentity` — only `publicKey`.
- `Signer` / `ExternalSignerAdapter` — only `publicKey` and `sign()`.
- `ReadOnlyAccount` — `signer` is statically `undefined`.
- `SigningAccount` — `signer: Signer`, never a raw key.

This is enforced at the type level, not just by convention: nothing you can
do with the public API produces an object whose *type* has a `secretKey`
field, other than passing one in to `LocalSignerConfig`/`createLocalAccount`/
`createLocalSigner`/`WalletKeypair` (the legacy `createWallet()`/
`importWallet()` helpers, unrelated to this layer — see
[Relationship to existing wallet helpers](./account-abstraction.md#relationship-to-existing-wallet-helpers)).

### Serialization is also covered, not just field access

A type-level guarantee is not enough on its own — `@stellar/stellar-sdk`'s
`Keypair` stores the raw secret as plain enumerable `Buffer` fields
(`_secretSeed`, `_secretKey`). Without a defensive override, `JSON.stringify()`
and Node's `console.log()`/`util.inspect()` on a `LocalSigner` (or any
`SigningAccount` holding one) would serialize those raw bytes even though no
public *type* exposes them. `LocalSigner` defines `toJSON()` and the Node
`util.inspect.custom` symbol so both paths return only `{ publicKey }`.
External `Signer`/`ExternalSignerAdapter` implementations you or a future
adapter package write are responsible for the same discipline — see
[What this model does NOT guarantee](#what-this-model-does-not-guarantee).

## What can sign — the capability check

`AccountAbstraction` is `ReadOnlyAccount | SigningAccount`, a discriminated
union on `canSign`. Check capability **before** attempting to sign, using the
`canSignTransaction()` type guard:

```ts
import { canSignTransaction, type AccountAbstraction } from 'stellar-pocketpay-sdk';

function describe(account: AccountAbstraction) {
  if (canSignTransaction(account)) {
    // account: SigningAccount — account.signer is Signer, not Signer | undefined
    return `can sign as ${account.signer.publicKey}`;
  }
  // account: ReadOnlyAccount
  return 'read-only, cannot sign';
}
```

This is preferred over wrapping `sign()` in a try/catch: the check is
explicit, narrows the type, and never touches the signer if it can't be
used.

### Orchestration checks capability before signing

`signWithAccount(unsigned, account)` (in the offline-preparation pipeline,
`src/transactions/offline-preparation.ts`) is the capability-checked entry
point for turning a built-but-unsigned transaction into a signed one from an
`AccountAbstraction`:

1. `canSignTransaction(account)` — if `false`, throws `TX_SIGNER_MISSING`
   *before* touching any signer.
2. `account.publicKey === unsigned.sourcePublicKey` — if it doesn't match,
   throws `TX_SIGNER_MISMATCH` *before* calling `sign()`.
3. Only then does it delegate to `signTransactionWithSigner(unsigned, account.signer)`.

A non-throwing variant, `safeSignWithAccount`, returns a typed
`PocketPayResult` instead.

## Typed signer errors

Two codes are specific to this layer, registered in `src/errors/codes.ts`
alongside the rest of the public error-code standard (see
[Error Handling](./error-handling.md)):

| Code | Category | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TX_SIGNER_MISSING` | `TRANSACTION` | The account has no signer attached (read-only) — checked before signing. |
| `TX_SIGNER_MISMATCH` | `TRANSACTION` | The signer's public key does not match the transaction's source account ("wrong signer"). |

Both are thrown as `PocketPayError` (the SDK's single error class — see
[Error Handling](./error-handling.md)) with a stable `code`, never as a
generic `Error`, so `error instanceof PocketPayError` and
`redactError()`/`describeError()` keep working uniformly across the SDK.

There is no third, signer-specific "unsupported capability" code. Instead,
"this signing method isn't supported yet" reuses the SDK's existing
unsupported-feature/capability standard — see the next section.

## External signer adapters — the extension point

`ExternalSignerAdapter` (in `src/account/types.ts`) is a **contract only** —
no concrete hardware/mobile/browser adapter ships in SDK core:

```ts
interface ExternalSignerAdapter extends Signer {
  readonly kind: 'hardware' | 'mobile' | 'browser' | 'remote';
  readonly isAvailable: boolean;
}
```

It extends `Signer`, so anything satisfying it already works with
`createAccountWithSigner(identity, adapter)` and with `signWithAccount()` —
no other SDK code needs to change when a real adapter ships.

The SDK's capability registry (`SDK_CAPABILITIES`, `src/errors/capabilities.ts`
— see [Capability Error Standard](./capability_error_standard.md)) already
tracks this extension point under `'signer.remote'`, currently
`status: 'planned'`. A future adapter that can't fulfil a signing request
(unsupported operation, disconnected device, wrong app version) should
signal that the same way any other unsupported SDK capability does:

```ts
import { assertCapability } from 'stellar-pocketpay-sdk';

async function sign(tx, networkPassphrase) {
  if (!deviceIsReachable()) {
    // Throws UnsupportedFeatureError (code SDK_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) because
    // 'signer.remote' is registered as 'planned', not 'supported'.
    assertCapability('signer.remote', false, { module: 'account', operation: 'sign' });
  }
  // ...
}
```

`signWithAccount()` does not catch, wrap, or reinterpret adapter errors — an
`UnsupportedFeatureError` thrown by `sign()` propagates unchanged to the
caller. This means a signer-specific "unsupported" error code would be
redundant; adapters use the same mechanism every other gated SDK capability
uses.

`isAvailable` is a cheap synchronous probe ("is this adapter wired up in the
current build"), not a guarantee that `sign()` will succeed — a device can
still be disconnected or reject the request when `sign()` is actually
called.

## What this model DOES guarantee

- A `ReadOnlyAccount` cannot be made to sign — `canSign` is fixed to `false`
  at the type level and at runtime (`signer` is always `undefined`).
- Signing capability is checked, and can be checked by the caller, before any
  signer is invoked — no implicit fallback to "try and see."
- A wrong signer (public key mismatch) is rejected before submission, with a
  typed, stable error code.
- `LocalSigner` — the SDK's own signer implementation — never exposes its
  secret through public fields, `JSON.stringify()`, or Node's
  `console.log()`/`util.inspect()`.
- No typed error thrown by this layer (`TX_SIGNER_MISSING`,
  `TX_SIGNER_MISMATCH`, or an `UnsupportedFeatureError` raised for
  `'signer.remote'`) includes secret material in its message, `safeMessage`,
  or any other field.

## What this model does NOT guarantee

- **Third-party `Signer`/`ExternalSignerAdapter` implementations are not
  sandboxed.** If you write a custom signer that closes over a secret and
  exposes it via a public field, `toString()`, or logging, this layer cannot
  prevent that — the guarantee above is specific to `LocalSigner`, the
  implementation the SDK ships and controls.
- **`WalletKeypair` (`createWallet()`/`importWallet()`) is a separate, older
  model that this layer does not change.** `secretKey` on a `WalletKeypair`
  is a plain string field — see [Wallet Backup Responsibility](./security.md#wallet-backup-responsibility).
  It is still the primary input to `sendXLM`/`sendAsset`/`depositToVault`/
  `withdrawFromVault`, none of which are part of this signer capability
  architecture (see [ADR-0004](./adr/0004-signer-capability-architecture.md#alternatives-considered)).
- **In-memory secrets are not zeroed or protected against process memory
  inspection.** `LocalSigner` reduces *accidental* exposure (serialization,
  logging) — it is not a substitute for a hardware wallet or HSM when that
  level of protection is required.
- **`isAvailable` on an `ExternalSignerAdapter` is advisory, not a
  guarantee.** A future adapter reporting `isAvailable: true` can still fail
  at `sign()` time.
